Note to: Innovative Percussion

I am huge fan of your products.  For this assignment I had to create a product landing page.  I have been using your products for years and chose to use your company as my model due to my comfort with your products.  The email form below does not work and used just for educational purposes.  If you do not approve of me using your company for my assignment, please email me at chriswolfdesign@gmail.com and I will be happy to take it down.  Thank you.
